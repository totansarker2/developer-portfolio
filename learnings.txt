2. Css variable

3. if you do display: flex, then every childs display: block
   wrap inline elements to a div, to prevent them to become inline to block

4. CSS combinator (div > p) - apply style to parent if it has a child with css
   apply css to a element, but if element has child then they also be affected, to prevent that use css combinator.


In css some attribute are affects child element and some doesn't affects
   e.g: font-size - affect to child element
        height,border - doesn't affect to child element

any tag selector always find on root level first then level-2 child element, level-3 child element and so on.
